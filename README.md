The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is a mathematical
theorem used in various fields, including computer
science, cryptography, engineering, number theory, and physics.
One of the real-world applications of CRT is optimizing electric
vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. Developing a robust and
efficient charging network is essential to maximize the potential of
EVs and reduce the reliance on fossil fuels. To achieve optimized
EV charging, smart charging systems can be used to ensure EVs
are charged at the most efficient times, and fast charging stations
can be installed in key locations. It is also important to ensure
that the energy used to power EVs comes from renewable sources.
By optimizing EV charging, we can minimize the time it takes
to charge an EV, reduce the overall cost of EV ownership, and
make electric vehicles a more convenient and affordable option
for drivers.
